## Day 1

### Setup

For working with the code you need npm (this is the same setup that we have used in CC1). If you don't have the setup anymore, have a look at [slides 13 - 16 of Seesion 07](https://ctechfilmuniversity.github.io/lecture_ws2324_creative_coding_1/03_slides/cc1_ws2324_07_slides.html#44) of CC1. 

### Run The Examples

For running the code examples:

* Unzip the folder
* With a terminal navigate into the folder 
* Install the dependencies with `npm install`
* Start a local server with `npm run dev`
