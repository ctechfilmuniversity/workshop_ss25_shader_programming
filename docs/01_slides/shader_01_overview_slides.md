## The Workshop

> Shader programming is in itself just a technology.

--

It can be accessed

--
* with a given interface within a software and environment (e.g., Unreal, three.js)

--
* with custom code (e.g., C++ and OpenGL)


---
## The Workshop

--

Technology

--
* Shader pipeline

--
* Example three.js

--
* Fragment shader 

--
* Example Unreal



--

Scenario

* Rendering a 3D scene in in a fragment shader

## 3D Engines

* A given environment such as a Unreal, Houdini, vvvv, TouchDesigner, p5, three.js etc.

--
* Assets such geometry, lights and materials already exists

--
* The engine does the rendering


???
  
This means we plug our shading development into a given environment such as p5, Unity, Houdini etc. and work with given assets such lights or material properties.

--

> 3D engines are a good option for complex scenes and realistic appearance.

Pipeline as it was used at Scanline VFX. Pipeline can vary a lot, depending on the production house.

.task[TASK:] Explain the steps

## 3D Engines

We are are going to use three.js as engine first.


---
## The Fragment Shader Only

--

> Why?

--

* Good intro into GLSL and GPU programming
* Powerful in itself for many real-time artistic effects


???
  

* In the industry 

--

One graphics processing unit is very limited regarding processing power and memory!  

--

Their beauty comes through **massive parallelization**.


???
  

> So what?

--

* We need graphics algorithms that are suitable in this context



---
.header[The Fragment Shader Only]

## Rendering a 3D Scene

We are building the whole scene within the fragments shader itself, including the rendering. 

--

<br />
Possible visual content is still limited in comparison to working within a 3D software.

--

> Fragment shaders are a good option for abstracted and simplified scenes based on procedural generation principles and whenever interactivity is crucial (e.g. in a performance scenario).

.header[The Fragment Shader Only | Rendering a 3D Scene]

## We Start With...

--

...nothing!

---

## Rendering a 3D Scene

--

> How?

--

We use *implicit geometry* descriptions and *sphere tracing* as rendering algorithm.

## Workshop Topics

--
* Shader Pipeline & GLSL

--
* Vertex and Fragment shader in three.js

--
* Implicit Geometry

--
* Rendering Algorithms

--
* Sphere Tracing

--
* 3D Scene Setup

--
* Transformations

--
* Constructive Solid Geometry

--
* Further Effects

--
* Examples

--

--
* Creative Exploration

---

## Workshop Topics

This workshop will not cover shading and lighting in detail. For that, there is the upcoming *Materials & Shading* workshop.

.center[<img src="./img/shading.png" alt="shading" style="width:50%;">]

???
  

* Shader programming is still dominantly used for materials
* The workshop will build upon the shader programming workshop

--

There might be another follow-up workshop regarding volumetric rendering.


---

## Learning Objectives

With this workshop you gain

--
* a theoretical understanding of shader pipelines

--
* a theoretical understanding of rendering a 3D scene in a real-time context, 

--
* practical experiences with GLSL, shader programming, and implementing a ray marched 3D scene.
