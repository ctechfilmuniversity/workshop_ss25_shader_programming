layout:false

.header[Shader Pipeline]

## GPU

A shader

--
* is a program that runs within the graphics pipeline on the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)

--
* tells the computer how to render each pixel

.footnote[[[Tuts+]](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-coding-graphics-shaders--cms-23313)]

--

> These programs are called shaders because they are often used to control lighting and shading effects, but there's no reason they can't handle other special effects. 



---
.header[Shader Pipeline]

## GPU

--
* Many separate processors

--
* Rendering is split into separate hardware units and calculations

--
* Much faster than CPU-based software renderer with only 1-8 processors

A GPU can contain thousands of microprocessors that can only perform simple tasks.

* GPU cores

--
*  Have a limited memory bank (VRAM)

--
* Can only execute simpler instructions

--
* Are blind: they cannot communicate with each other

--
* Forget: they cannot remember previous frames

--
* Designed for massive parallelization

.footnote[[[Reilly Bova]](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring20/cos426/precepts/Precept-10.pdf)]

* VRAM has to store the frame buffer, textures, and processing data for
each of the 1K+ cores (itâ€™s crowded). Thus, cores have limited memory.

Shader programs run on the GPU, and are highly parallelised. Each vertex shader only transforms 1 vertex. If we have a mesh of 2000 vertices, then 2000 vertex shaders will be launched when we draw it. Because we can compute each one separately, we can also run them all in parallel. Depending on the number of processors on the GPU, you might be able to compute all of your mesh's vertex shaders simultaneously.

Difference Between Fragments and Pixels

A pixel is a "picture element". In OpenGL lingo, pixels are the elements that make up the final 2D image that it draws inside a window on your display. A fragment is a pixel-sized area of a surface. A fragment shader determines the colour of each one. Sometimes surfaces overlap - we then have more than 1 fragment for 1 pixel. All of the fragments are drawn, even the hidden ones.

Each fragment is written into the framebuffer image that will be displayed as the final pixels. If depth testing is enabled it will paint the front-most fragments on top of the further-away fragments. In this case, when a farther-away fragment is drawn after a closer fragment, then the GPU is clever enough to skip drawing it, but it's actually quite tricky to organise the scene to take advantage of this, so we'll often end up executing many redundant fragment shader invocations.

* Comparison of Selected OpenGL4-Capable GPUs
* Because there is a lot of variation in user GPU hardware, we can only make very general assumptions about the ideal number of vertices or facets each mesh should have for best performance. Because we only draw one mesh at a time, keeping the number of separate meshes drawn per-scene to a low-ish level is often beneficial (reducing the batch count per rendered frame) - the idea is to keep as many of the processors in use at once as possible.

* The **vertex shader** is responsible for the transformations applied on the vertices; mainly, the coordinate transforms required for the position, but it can also perform other calculations (e.g. Gouraud shading).
* The **geometry shader** is able to remove and insert primitives into the primitive stream, right before actual rasterization begins.
* **Tesselation shaders** are newer than geometry shaders, but come earlier in the pipeline. They were introduced, because
    * geometry shaders were not general enough (what if we need more data for subdivision than the _ADJACENCY primitives can carry?)
    * subdivision is a very common problem, but complicated to implement, and it would make sense to centralize some support.
* As a solution, OpenGL includes tesselation shaders, and splits the tesselation problem into three subcomponents:
    * The tesselation control shader decides into how many primitives the incoming GL_PATCH should be subdivided (and additional details)
    * The hard-coded tesselation primitive generator performs the actual subdivision
    * The tesselation evaluation shader gets to move the patch vertices resulting from the subdivision.

Overview
* Recent graphics hardware has become extremely powerful and a strong desire to harness this power for work (both graphics and non-graphics) that does not fit the traditional graphics pipeline well has emerged. To address this, this extension adds a new single-stage program type known as a compute program. This program may contain one or more compute shaders which may be launched in a manner that is essentially stateless. This allows arbitrary workloads to be sent to the graphics hardware with minimal disturbance to the GL state machine.
* In most respects, a compute program is identical to a traditional OpenGL program object, with similar status, uniforms, and other such properties. It has access to many of the same resources as fragment and other shader types, such as textures, image variables, atomic counters, and so on. However, it has no predefined inputs nor any fixed-function outputs. It cannot be part of a pipeline and its visible side effects are through its actions on images and atomic counters.
* OpenCL is another solution for using graphics processors as generalized compute devices. This extension addresses a different need. For example, OpenCL is designed to be usable on a wide range of devices ranging from CPUs, GPUs, and DSPs through to FPGAs. While one could implement GL on these types of devices, the target here is clearly GPUs. Another difference is that OpenCL is more full featured and includes features such as multiple devices, asynchronous queues and strict IEEE semantics for floating point operations. This extension follows the semantics of OpenGL - implicitly synchronous, in-order operation with single-device, single queue logical architecture and somewhat more relaxed numerical precision requirements. Although not as feature rich, this extension offers several advantages for applications that can tolerate the omission of these features. Compute shaders are written in GLSL, for example and so code may be shared between compute and other shader types. Objects are created and owned by the same context as the rest of the GL, and therefore no interoperability API is required and objects may be freely used by both compute and graphics simultaneously without acquire-release semantics or object type translation.

Documentation
* Compute shaders cannot have any user-defined input variables. If you wish to provide input to a CS, you must use the implementation-defined inputs coupled with resources like storage buffers or Textures. You can use the shader's invocation and work group indices to decide which data to fetch and process. 
* Compute shaders do not have output variables. If you wish to have a CS generate some output, you must use a resource to do so. Shader storage buffers and Image Load Store operations are useful ways to output data from a CS.

They have the advantage of running on the GPU in a parallel fashion and be very fast and, therefore, are extremely handy for accelerating rendering techniques or for running GPUGPU (General Purpose GPU) algorithms. That means that they can be used to do all the expensive grunt work on the GPU and work with the CPU to present the results or used in any way you can think of.

To the programmer, OpenGL is a set of commands that allow the specification of
shader programs or shaders, data used by shaders, and state controlling aspects of
OpenGL outside the scope of shaders. Typically the data represent geometry in two
or three dimensions and texture images, while the shaders control the geometric
processing, rasterization of geometry and the lighting and shading of fragments
generated by rasterization, resulting in rendering geometry into the framebuffer.

Whatâ€™s missing from C in GLSL syntax:


--
* No implicit casting => You must explicitly cast everything

--
* No libraries => You must write/provide all the code yourself

--
* No dynamic memory => All memory is static

--
* No recursion => You must unroll recursive functions into loops

--

--
* No objects (but there is `struct`)

--
* No char, no string

# Vertex & Fragment Shader

---
## Shader Pipeline

Many graphic environments give you access to 

* Vertex shader
* Fragment shader

--

This means we have control over vertices and fragments:

* Position vertices
* Color fragments

.header[Shader Pipeline | GLSL]

## Vertex Shader

--
* Called once per vertex in the scene

--
* Generates clip space coordinates

* Perspective Frustum and Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC)
*  In perspective projection, a 3D point in a truncated pyramid frustum (eye coordinates) is mapped to a cube (NDC); the range of x-coordinate from [l, r] to [-1, 1], the y-coordinate from [b, t] to [-1, 1] and the z-coordinate from [-n, -f] to [-1, 1].
* Note that the eye coordinates are defined in the right-handed coordinate system, but NDC uses the left-handed coordinate system. That is, the camera at the origin is looking along -Z axis in eye space, but it is looking along +Z axis in NDC. Since glFrustum() accepts only positive values of near and far distances, we need to negate them during the construction of GL_PROJECTION matrix.

.header[Shader Pipeline | GLSL]

## Vertex Shader

* Called once per vertex
* Generates clip space coordinates

It always takes the form

```glsl
void main() {   

    // ...
    gl_Position = makeClipspaceCoordinates;
}
```


???
  

* Each time you have to set the special global variable, `gl_Position` to some clip space coordinates.

## Make Clip Space Coordinates



```glsl
uniform mat4 uModelViewMatrix;
uniform mat4 uProjectionMatrix;
uniform mat3 uNormalMatrix;

attribute vec3 aPosition;

void main() {

    // Object space -> Camera space (view frustum)
    vec4 viewModelPosition = uModelViewMatrix * vec4(aPosition, 1.0);

    // Camera space -> Clip space
    gl_Position = uProjectionMatrix * viewModelPosition;
}

.header[Shader Pipeline | GLSL]

## Fragment Shader

--
* Called once per fragment

--
* Provides a color for the current fragment

It always takes the form

```glsl
void main() {

    gl_FragColor = makeAColor;
}

Each time you have to set the special global variable, `gl_FragColor` to some color.

* Uniforms (values that stay the same for every pixel of a single draw call)
* Textures (data from pixels/texels)
* Varyings (data passed from the vertex shader and interpolated)


```glsl
uniform mat4 uViewMatrix;

varying vec3 v_normal;
varying vec3 v_pos_view;


void main(void) 
{
    get_light(v_pos_view, v_normal);
    color = compute_reflectance(v_pos_view, v_normal);
    ...
    gl_FragColor = color;
}

Data that changes between each vertices (like their position) is called attribute and can only be used in the vertex shader.

Data that doesn't change between vertices (like the mesh position or a color) is called uniform and can be use in both the vertex shader and the fragment shader.

We can send data from the vertex shader to the fragment shader using varying.
